//createUserWithEmailAndPassword: This function is used to create a new user account in your Firebase project with an email address and a password.
//-When you call this function and provide an email and password, Firebase will create a new user account associated with that email and password.
//signInWithEmailAndPassword: This function is used to sign in an existing user with their email and password.
//-When you call this function and provide the email and password of an existing user, Firebase will authenticate the user if the credentials are correct, allowing them to access protected parts of your application.
//onAuthStateChanged: This is a listener function that allows you to track the authentication state of a user.
//-When you set up this listener and provide a callback function, Firebase will call this function whenever a user signs in or signs out.
//This is useful for things like updating the UI based on whether a user is signed in or not.
//signOut: This function is used to sign out the currently authenticated user.
//When you call this function, Firebase will log out the user, making them no longer authenticated and protecting any authenticated resources.
